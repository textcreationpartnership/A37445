            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:97586:4"/>the three great Peſts in the Church, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded three Chapters upon thoſe Subjects, and after ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one thing after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it came to make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Part of this Work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. My Lord, Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip has had many Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and Worthy Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and I cannot forbear to mention to Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Your immediate Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor my Lord Biſhop <hi>Hacket,</hi> with what indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable Induſtry did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, or rather re-edifie the Church at <hi>Lichfield,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:97586:4"/>he happily lived to finiſh, a Work could hardly have been performed by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; how circumſpectly, prudently and diligently did he govern his Church, never abſenting himſelf, unleſs in his Majeſtie's and Countrey's Service; how conſtantly did he viſit and preach through his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs? A Religious Pattern for all his Clergy, what great Inſight had he both in the Civil, Canon and Common Laws, that related to the Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? How oft did he ſit

Nay, what did he neglect that became a Worthy Prelate to do? and for his deep and profound Learning in his Function certainly few exceeded him, if I have any Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. My Lord, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved three things perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate mens memory to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, Children, Learned Writings and publick and eminent Buildings, he was fortunate in them all; he has left a Worthy Son to inherit his Name, Virtue, and Temporal Eſtate; he

            <p>IT is obſerved in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of Sir <hi>Edward Cokes</hi> Reports in the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſters</hi> caſe,<note place="margin">Co. 2.44. b.</note> that there were two great perſecutions of the Chriſtian Religion, the one under <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate. The firſt by murdering the Prieſts that by their preaching ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the Chriſtian Religion, the latter by ſpoiling the Church of its Revenues: the former, contrary to expectation ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and not ſuppreſſed Religion: for it has proved in all Ages that <hi>ſanguis marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum est ſemen Eccleſiae,</hi> for the
<pb facs="tcp:97586:7"/>patient ſuffering of ſo many Martyrs of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians gave the World a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Teſtimony that thoſe poor Chriſtians had ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Divine aſſiſtance to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe with patience ſo much cruelty that no others durſt put themſelves to the trial of. But the taking away the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Church Martyred the Prieſthood it ſelf, and ſtruck at the foundation; for when People ſaw there was nothing left but perſecutions, no ſuſtenance for thoſe that Miniſtred at the Altar, it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them to breed their Children up to a ſtudy that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced them to nothing but
<pb facs="tcp:97586:8"/>danger, which introduced great ignorance of the true Knowledg of God and Religion, ſo that as one killed the Prieſts, the other deſtroyed the very Prieſthood it ſelf. And though the Apoſtle St.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.9.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> got his Living by his labour, that he might not become burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to his Proſelytes;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11, 12, 14, 16. Mat. 10.10. 1 Tim. 5.18.</note> yet the ſame Apoſtle tells us that <hi>the Labourer is worthy of his hire,</hi> and that by the Law of <hi>Moſes the Oxe was not to be muzled that treads forth the Corn;</hi> and by way of expoſtulation in another place ſays,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9.7, 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>who goes on warfare at his own charge? who plants a Vineyard and eats not of the fruit thereof? and who feeds a
<pb facs="tcp:97586:8"/>Flock and eats not of the milk thereof? for he that ploweth ſhould plow in hope, and he that thraſheth ſhould be partaker of his hope.</hi> And again, ſays he, <hi>is it a great thing that thoſe that ſow to you Spiritual things ſhould reap car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?</hi> And do you not know (ſays the ſame Apoſtle) <hi>that they that Miniſter about holy things live of the things of the Temple, and that they that wait at the Altar, are partakers with the Altar;</hi> for ſo hath the Lord ordained, <hi>that they that preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;</hi> what effect this Doctrine wrought amongſt the Primitive Chriſtians, you may read in the fourth Chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97586:9"/>of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> where it is ſaid, that <hi>as many as were poſſeſſors of Houſes or Lands ſold them, and brought the prices of things that were ſold, and laid them down at the Apoſtles feet; and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution was made to every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he had need.</hi> But the Chriſtians of this preſent Age are ſo far from ſelling their Houſes and Lands, and laying the price at the Apoſtles feet, that they will rather detain that from the Clergy, which by Law and right is due to them. But, certainly, had the ſincerity of the Primitive Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, I ſhould never have needed to have ſet pen to the paper upon this ſubject I am
<pb facs="tcp:97586:9"/>now about, which is, <hi>the Law of Tithes or Tithing;</hi> a duty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by the Laws of this, as of other Nations, for the maintainance of the ſecular Clergy, and for their ſake it is that I have undertaken this work. There was a Tithing Table publiſhed many years ago By a Batchelor of Laws; wherein he has learnedly ſet forth the manner of Tithing by the Canon and Eccleſiaſtical Laws; but thoſe Laws and the Common Laws of this Realm differing in many things wherein the Common Law is to be preferred; that Tithing Table has often led both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Pariſhioners into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:97586:10"/>errors, beſides the ſeveral diſcharges from payment of Tithes, either abſolutely, or <hi>ſub modo,</hi> of divers Lands in <hi>England,</hi> by the Statutes or Common Laws makes great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration here from the Canon Laws, to rectifie which, and, as near as may be, to reconcile the Canon and Common Laws, I did by the perſwaſion of ſome Reverend Divines firſt make ſome Animadverſions upon that Tithing Table, but when I had done that, conſidering there were many more things in relation to Tithing, than I could conveniently apply to that Text concerning Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Cuſtoms, Compoſitions,
<pb facs="tcp:97586:10"/>and other priviledges, beſides the Laws concerning Offerings, Mortuaries, and other Church duties fit for all men to know, as well Lay as Clergy: I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured upon this larger work, which I the rather did becauſe I do not find any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that hath publiſhed any compleat work in this kind, or to reconcile the Common and Canon Laws, that kind of learning lying diſperſed in our Law Books, I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in favour of the Parſons and Vicars, taken up a former reſolution, and adventured to expoſe my ſelf to the publick cenſure. And though I cannot promiſe any perfection in this
<pb facs="tcp:97586:11"/>work, yet I dare preſume to ſay it is the moſt perfect work of this nature yet extant; though I can pretend to nothing of it but the errors and miſtakes, which I will be thankful to any body that will friendly correct, that I may make it more exact in a ſecond Edition if I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. The hindrance of converſing with the learned, by reaſon of my confinement to the Country, and publick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries, hath hindred me of ſome helps I might have had thereby. Perhaps it may not be ſo acceptable to thoſe in whoſe favour I have writ it, becauſe it comes from the pen of one who profeſſes himſelf a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="tcp:97586:11"/>Lawyer. But in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in this Nation, wherein the common Laws and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of the Country prevail againſt the Canon and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Laws; this ſubject is not altogether improper, if not moſt proper for a common Lawyer. And truly I have through this diſcourſe dealt with as impartial an hand as the matter would admit. And though the Clergy may think it to their prejudice, that I have at large ſet forth the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſcharges by which lands are freed from the payment of Tithes; yet in that I have given them a clear light, which lands cannot be ſo priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:97586:12"/>and what Preſcriptions and <hi>modus decimandi</hi> is not good, being well aſſured that there are more Lands at this day eſcape payment of Tithes upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſome priviledg, to which they have no Right, than thoſe that pay Tithes, and might legally be diſcharged; But when I have done my beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſerve the Reverend Clergy, I cannot give them In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to depend upon their own Judgments, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon any thing here writ; for though this may ſuffice to give them ſome light, what ſhall be due to them; yet I cannot hope by any thing I can write, to make them complete Lawy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
<pb facs="tcp:97586:12"/>for many <hi>Quaere</hi>'s will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, that no foreſight of mine could give an Anſwer to: but this benefit I hope they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by my labours, that they may put their Caſe, and make their doubts known more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently to the learned. I had no ſooner finiſhed this little Tract concerning Tithes, but I conſidered there were many other things almoſt as uſeful for a Clergyman to know, as the Law of Tithes: And though Mr. <hi>Hughes</hi> of <hi>Graves-Inn</hi> many years ſince publiſhed a learned Tract, which he intitled the <hi>Parſon's Law;</hi> yet there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more things neceſſary for a Clergyman to know, that are
<pb facs="tcp:97586:13"/>there only briefly, or not at all, touched upon, and of ſuch force that they muſt either be performed and obſerved to make a man a compleat Parſon, or to make him none, though never ſo exactly inſtituted and inducted, if omitted. I have therefore in the firſt place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the Law of Tithes ſhewed, what Simony is, and what danger thoſe run themſelves into, that are guilty of it, what things every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Vicar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to do before, at, and after, his Inſtitution and Induction, to make him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Parſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what Dilapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations are, and how puniſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, what priviledges the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
<pb facs="tcp:97586:13"/>have at this day by the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> what charges and payments their Tithes and Church-livings are ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, what Cauſes of Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have been allowed of by the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> what Leaſes they may take or ſet, and what Statutes they may fall in danger of; and of plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and who is qualified to have them, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be accepted, Non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and many other things neceſſary for every <hi>Clergy-man</hi> to know: I have divided the whole into Two Books, and them again into ſeveral Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Paragraphs, and added a ſhort Table for the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb facs="tcp:97586:14"/>finding of any thing in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I have likewiſe added a Liſt or Catalogue of all the Abbeys and Priories, that were valued in the Kings Books at 200 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> or upwards, and which were diſſolved by the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the Lands of which can only pretend to any priviledg to be diſcharged of the payment of Tithes; in which I have rather choſen to write after Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> being a ſure Author, than Mr. <hi>Speed,</hi> in whom I have obſerved many Miſtakes; I muſt beg the Readers Patience to correct the Miſtakes of the <hi>Printer</hi> (which are too many by reaſon of my abſence from the Preſs) by the
<pb facs="tcp:97586:14"/>
               <hi>Errata</hi> annexed, and for my own I ſhall take it kindly from any body, that will in a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner inform me of them; for <hi>Humanum est errare,</hi> and though I may have cauſe to be aſhamed of them, yet I will never be aſhamed to amend.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. III. <hi>The third Chapter ſhews, in what Caſe it is neceſſary that the Biſhop have a</hi> Jure Patronatus, <hi>and how the ſame is to be proceeded in, and what is the effect and fruit of the ſame.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IF two Patrons preſent to one and the ſame Church by ſeveral Titles,<note place="margin">In what caſesa Church ſhall be ſaid litigious.</note> the Church is become litigious; becauſe the Biſhop knows not which hath the very true and rightful Title to the ſame, and by Conſequence knows not which Clerk to admit: And I take it the Church is not leſs litigious, though they both preſent the ſame perſon; becauſe when the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop admits him as the Clerk of the one, he puts the other out of poſſeſſion, and conſequently to his action; and the Biſhop becomes a Diſturber, if he who is put out of poſſeſſion prove to have the better Title.</p>
                     <p>Now the Biſhop in this Caſe,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Where a</hi> Jure Patronatus <hi>is neceſſary, and how to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in.</hi>

                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:97586:31"/>
                     <p>But it ſeems a queſtion in our Books,<note place="margin">35 H. 6.18. b. 19. a⸫; 34 H. 6.12. a⸫; Hob. 317⸪ 34 H. 6.38. 5 H. 7.22. a. it is made a Quaere.</note> whether the Biſhop is bound to ſue the <hi>Jure Patronatus</hi> at his own coſt and peril, or only at the prayer and at the coſt of the Party that prays it, or of both Parties; but the better opinion ſeems to be, and ſo is the practice, that the ſame is ſued at the prayer, and at the coſt of the one, or both the Parties if they joyn.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas the Church may become litigious by double or plural Preſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo it may become more litigeous by the <hi>Jure Patronatus;</hi> for if two Patrons preſent, and each of them prays a <hi>Jure Patronatus</hi> by himſelf (as they may) and the one Jury gives a Verdict for the ones Title, and the other for the others Title, here the Biſhop receives no Direction at all, but the Church ſtill remains litigious.</p>
                     <p>But here ariſes another great queſtion, whether the Biſhop in this Caſe may let the Church Lapſe, and collate; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be not bound to admit one of the Clerks at his Election, or at his peril. Mr. <hi>Serjeant Callis</hi> in his reading was of opinion,<note place="margin">Callis Read. 3. 21 H. 6.44. a⸪ Quaere.</note> he might refuſe both Clerks in this Caſe, and ſuffer the Church to Lapſe: and ſo is the Book in 21 H. 6. by <hi>Newton</hi> and <hi>Paſton. tamen inde quaere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as a Church may become litigious by a <hi>Jure Patronatus:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">41 H. 6.45. a⸪</note> ſo it may become li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigious after a <hi>Jure Patronatus,</hi> and a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict given for one of the Parties; for if a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97586:31"/>
                        <hi>Jure Patronatus</hi> be awarded, and a Verdict given for one of the Parties, and before the Patron preſents, for whom the Verdict was given, and prays admittance of his Clerk (as ought to do, before the Biſhop is bound to admit his Clerk) another preſents here; the Church is become litigious <hi>de novo,</hi> and the Biſhop in this Caſe, as it ſeems, may award a new <hi>Jure Patronatus</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the right of Patronage between the new and the old Patron, for whom the Title was found in the former.</p>
                     <p>But ſome have thought,<note place="margin">21 H. 6.44. Callis Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 29. Hob. 319⸫;</note> that though the Church be not litigious by double or plural Preſentations, yet the Biſhop, if he doubt of the Patrons Title that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, may award a <hi>Jure Patronatus,</hi> and inquire of ſuch Patron's Title, and by that means prevent the ſurpriſe, that may happen to other pretenders by ſudden ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Clerk, and in caſe the right of Patronage be found for a
<note n="†" place="margin">34 H. 6.40. a⸪</note> ſtranger, the Biſhop may admit his Clerk.</p>
                     <p>But it ſeems,<note place="margin">Hob. 317..</note> that if the Biſhop admit the Clerk, that is preſented before the Church becomes litigious by a ſecond Preſentation, that the Biſhop acquits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thereby from being a Diſturber; but by this means the Biſhop may do great wrong in ſurpriſing other Patrons that have right: And the Law doth not ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the Biſhop's proceeding, but that, as has been ſaid, he may take convenirnt time
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97586:32"/>to examine the Clerk, that other preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may take notice of the vacancy.</p>
                     <p>But though the Church by any of the means aboveſaid be become litigious, yet I think there is no doubt but that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop may admit either Clerk without a <hi>Jure Patronatus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hob. 317..</note> but then he doth it at a double peril; for if the Patron, whoſe Clerk he admits, have not a good Title, or having a good Title do not make it out in a <hi>quare impedit,</hi> or other Action brought for the Church, the Biſhop will be made a diſturber.</p>
                     <p>And it ſeems likewiſe,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>How far the Biſhop is bound by a Verdict</hi> in Jure pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron.</note> that the Biſhop is not ſo bound by the Verdict in a <hi>Jure Patronatus,</hi> but that he may admit the contrary Clerk, if he ſee cauſe, or be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied he has the better Title; but this ſeems to be againſt Juſtice and the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Law.<note place="margin">34 H. 6 11. b⸪ Hob. 318 ⸫</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>And Sir <hi>Henry Hobart</hi> was of opinion, that an action of the caſe lyes againſt the Biſhop by the Patron that is ſo diſturbed, if in a <hi>quare Impedit</hi> he prove to have the better Title, and recover his damages by reaſon of the delay and trouble the Biſhop hath thereby put the Patron to; but then the Biſhop muſt not be made a Defendant in the <hi>Quare Impedit:</hi>

                        <hi>Hughes</hi> in his Parſons Law puts two Caſes, which he is of opinion are out of danger of this Law.

                     <p>But his other Caſe ſeems more doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Rectories in one Church.</hi>
                        </note> and it is put where a Church has two Rectories, and each has cure of Souls <hi>per ſe,</hi> and are incompatible, and one perſon obtains both theſe Livings without quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaton or diſpenſation. This Caſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives to be both out of the danger of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97586:41"/>this Act and the Canon. 1. Becauſe it is not in <hi>pluribus Eccleſiis.</hi> 2. When there is ſeveral Advowſons in one Church, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parſon hath the whole cure of Souls, and the words of the Statute are, <hi>having one Benefice with cure of Souls of the value of eight pounds takes and accepts another benefice with cure of Souls,</hi> &amp;c. But here the Church is one and the ſame, and the cure of Souls the ſame; and therefore as he conceives neither within the danger of the Statute or Canon: but in a private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that I have, this very point came in queſtion in the latter end of the Queen's time, and the Reporter ſays,<note place="margin">Cooper verſ.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97586:47"/>for the Law intended to inflict puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Patron, being the Author of this corruption, by the loſs of his preſentation; and upon the Incumbent, who came in by ſuch a corrupt Patron, by the loſs of his Living, although he never knew of the corrupt Contract; but if the Preſentee were not cognizant of the corruption, then he's not within the clauſe of disability within the ſame Statute; and ſo (ſays he) was the opinion of all the Judges of <hi>Sarjeant-Inn</hi> in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet.

                     <p>There is of late time a practice intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by corrupt Patrons, that,<note place="margin">Bonds for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation.</note> if not nipt early in the budding, will make this good Law of no effect; I mean the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Bonds for reſignation. And this practice took its riſe from two caſes in Sir <hi>George Crook's</hi> Reports.</p>
                     <p>The firſt was between <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> 8. <hi>Jac.</hi> The Caſe was thus:<note place="margin">Cro. Jac. 248.274.</note> 
                        <hi>Jones</hi> had a Son which he intended to be a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy Man, and having obtained a Preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> for the Church of <hi>Streetham</hi> agreed with the Defendant that he ſhould be preſented, ſo that he would reſign when <hi>Jones</hi> his Son was qualified for the Living; whereupon the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant entred into a Bond of a thouſand Marks penalty to the Plaintiff upon this condition (having firſt recited the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) that if the Defendant within three Months after requeſt ſhould abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely reſign his ſaid Benefice, that then <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in an action of debt brought upon this Bond the Defendant pleaded <hi>non requiſivit,</hi> which was found againſt him; and in arreſt of Judgment it was moved, that this Bond was made for the performance of a Symoniacal contract, and therefore void; but notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Court gave Judgment for the Plaintiff, and two reaſons are given for the Judgment; the firſt was becauſe there was no averment of the Symony,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97586:49"/>ſecond that it was not material as to the Bond, becauſe that Statute did not make the Bond or Contracts void, but only the preſentation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for this I clearly infer from the concluſion of the caſe. But I confeſs the ſenſe of the Court was, that in truth if a man be preparing a Son for the Clergy, and have a Living in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal which falls void before his Son be ready, he may lawfully take a bond of ſuch perſon as he ſhall preſent to reſign, when his Son is become capable of ſuch Living; and I have nothing to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that opinion, but it is very juſt and reaſonable, nature obliging that every one ſhould take care for his poſterity: but if a Patron take a Bond abſolutely to reſign upon requeſt without any ſuch cauſe as the preferment of a Son, or to avoid plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, or non-reſidence, or ſuch reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cauſe, but only to a corrupt end and purpoſe to exact Money by this Bond from the Incumbent, or attempt it, though perhaps the Bond may be good againſt the Perſon that entred into it; yet I am clear of opinion for my own part, that the ſaid Bond makes the Church void, and gives the preſentation to the King; and it ſhould ſeem in <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Laurence's</hi> caſe, that if Symony had been averred, it would have been left to a Jury to have adjudged what the intention of the corrupt Patron was.</p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:97586:49"/>
                     <p>The other Caſe upon which theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Simoniſts build,<note place="margin">Cro. Car. 180. Hur. in Jones 220.</note> was between <hi>Babbing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Wood,</hi> 5 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. B. R. where the Caſe was likewiſe in debt upon an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a Condition, that whereas the Plaintiff intended to preſent the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to ſuch a Living, that if the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant upon requeſt after his admiſſion ſhould reſign, that then the Bond to be void, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon <hi>Oyer</hi> of this Bond and Condition, the Defendant demurred, and Judgment was given for the Plaintiff: But all the Court conceived, that if the Defendant had averred, that the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been made with intent to exact money, make a Leaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which in it ſelf had been Simony; then upon ſuch a Plea peradventure it might have appeared to have been Simony, and then it might have been a queſtion, whether the Bond had been good or no; but upon this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur it did not appear there was any Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacal Contract, and ſuch a Bond might be made upon a good and lawful deſign, as the preferment of a Son, as in <hi>Jone's</hi> and <hi>Laurence's</hi> Caſe before, to avoid non-Reſidence, Pluralities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that it appears by both theſe Caſes, that Bonds taken upon prudent and juſt ends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign are non-Simoniacal; but where ſuch Bonds are taken upon corrupt deſigns, and it be made appear by any ſubſequent practice or action, it is clearly Simony,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97586:50"/>as if the Bond had been expreſly to pay money; for what difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Bond expreſly to pay money, and a Bond to reſign (which is to pay money, if the Patron ſay, either pay me ſo much or reſign when all the world knows in ſuch a Caſe the Parſon muſt pay the money, or reſign) and be undone? And the world ſhall never perſwade me, that thoſe reverend Judges that gave theſe Judgments ever intended further: and I hope that thoſe reverend Judges, that now ſupply their places, will diſcountenance and diſcourage ſuch practices that tend ſo much to the ruine of the Church and Religion; for I know no Law that tends more to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of learned and religious men than this Law doth, and therefore ought to have a benign conſtruction to the end it was deſigned.</p>

<note place="margin">3 Inſt. 155⸪ <hi>The reaſon of the Paragraph againſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate Admiſſ.</hi>
                        </note> which Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> (who was a member of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) tells us was added to avoid haſty and precipitate admiſſions, inſtitutions and inductions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the prejudice of thoſe that have right to preſent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by putting them to their actions to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their rights, and there is ſeldom bribes (as I may ſay) in this Caſe given, where the Patron has a good and ſure Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
                     <p>The taking or giving above the uſual Fees in this Caſe is as well dangerous to the Clerk as the Officer: for the Church ſhall be void, ſo that the Patron, that has right to preſent muſt preſent again; and the Uſurper and Officer, that takes more than his Fees for ſuch expedition, forfeits double the value of the Benefice for a year, not according to the rate in the firſt fruit Office, but according to the very true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue: but upon this Clauſe no diſability reſts upon the Incumbent, but that he may by the true Patron be preſented again; nor lapſe, till after ſix months from the time of notice given by the Biſhop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And obſerve the penning of this clauſe:<note place="margin">When the Church ſhall be void.</note> it is not that the Church ſhall be <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void, or that the Inſtitution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be void; but that it ſhall be eft ſoon void, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97586:53"/>that the Patron ſhall preſent, as if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were naturally dead: ſo that it ſhould ſeem the Church is once full by this inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and induction; and hence there may ſome doubts ariſe, whether the Church ſhall be void <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> or whether it muſt be avoided by Eccleſiaſtical Sentence of Deprivation: but it ſeems to me, that the Patron may preſent immediately without any Sentence Eccleſiaſtical.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">Reſignation and Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges Simoniacal.</note> The third Paragraph of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute is made againſt ſuch as ſhall corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for money, penſion, or other benefit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign or exchange their Livings with any other: in that caſe as well the giver as the taker forfeits double the Sum of money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> given and received; but this clauſe works no advoidance or diſability in the perſon that is guilty.</p>
                     <p>The fourth Paragraph preſerves the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction,<note place="margin">The Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſaved.</note> that they may proceed judicially to cenſure the Parties for their corruption in buying and ſelling Church-preferments: wherein as ſhould ſeem the Eccleſiaſtical Laws in ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are more ſevere than this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; for by that Law, as I take it, he that is convicted of Simony,<note place="margin">Cro. El. 788, 789.</note> is after inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated not only to that Living, but to all other Church preferments; but of this be informed by the Canoniſt.

                     <p>I am now come to the laſt Paragraph of this Statute,<note place="margin">Corrupt giving Orders and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſes to preach.</note> which is alſo a two-edged Sword, that puniſhes as well the giver as taker of greater fee or reward than the ordinary and juſt fees for, or for procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, any perſon to be ordained or made a miniſter, or giving any order or licenſe to preach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but is more ſevere upon the Clergy-man than the Officer; for the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer only forfeits forty ſhillings, but the Clergy forfeits ten pounds, and all the Livings he ſhall take within ſeven years, are made void by this Law after Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; ſo that for ſeven years an Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city lyes upon the Clerk; how careful ought Clergy-men to be, what Fees they give for their Orders?

                     </p>
                     <p>And if the goods of the Church ſhall not ſuffice, then the Gloſs tells us, <hi>Si Rector bona Eccleſiaſtica expenderit in melioratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem patrimonii ſui, vel ſi propter nimiam diligentiam propriorum negotiorum neglexe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit negotia Eccleſiae procurare, Et ſic Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia ſit dampnum paſſa; tenetur ſatisfacerc de bonis ſuis patronalibus, ſi quae habuerit.</hi> But there has been made a further queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether ſatisfaction for dilapidations ſhould be preferred in payment before Debts and Legacies: And as the Common Law prefers the payment of Debts before dammage for Dilapidations; So the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Law prefers the dammage for Dilapidations before the payment of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies; to which hear what the Gloſs ſays: <hi>Si Legatarii tanquam Creditores petant legata ſibi relicta, &amp; Praelatus petat ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus reparationis Edificiorum Eccleſiae; talis Praelatus debet praeferre caeteris Legatariis:</hi> and gives this reaſon. <hi>Nam Legata ſolvi non debent niſi prius deducto aere alieno.</hi> So that the Eccleſiaſtical Law agrees with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97586:63"/>the Common Law in this, that Debts are to be preferred before Legacies.</p>

                     <p>But ſome have fancied (and perhaps not without reaſon; for this ſeems not to be a general Decree, but a particular Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) that the parochial Right of Tithes was not generally ſettled of long after, that is, by a Canon made in the Council of <hi>Lyons,</hi> which was in the year of our Lord 1274. in which Council there is a Canon for the ſettling the parochial Right of Tithes. But whether that were the Original, or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of ſome other Decree or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, I dare not take upon me to judge: but certain it is, that about this Century the parochial Right of Tithes was ſettled in general. But though this decretal Epiſtle of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third be not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, yet it was obligatory as to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> ſo that in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the parochial Right of Tithes may take its date from the time of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal Epiſtle, which was, as above is ſaid, in the year 1200.</p>
                     <p>But after the Parochial Right of Tithes was ſettled, it is clear, that no Lay-man was capable of Tithes in pernancy but in particular Caſes, till the Statutes,

                     <p>By this Canon the payment of the Tithes of Wool and Lambs is ſetled in this manner,<note place="margin">How Wool and Lamb is to be paid.</note> that if the Pariſhioner have under ſeven Lambs or Fleeces he ſhall pay a half peny for every Lamb and Fleece, and if there be ſeven Lambs or Fleeces, and under ten, then the Parſon or <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to allow a half peny for every one that is wanting; but where this Canon gives the Rector election to take his Tithe in this manner, or let them run on till a Lamb or Fleece be due in the enſuing Year; that is not allowed by our Law,<note place="margin">P. 14.

                     <p>By the Canon the Tithe of Milk is to be paid in Cheeſe whilſt the Pariſhioner makes Cheeſe; but in Autumn and Winter, it is to be paid in kind: but this part of the Canon is generally overruled by the Cuſtom of the place; for in many places they pay the Milk in kind all the year, in ſome places they pay only Cheeſe, and in ſome neither Cheeſe nor Milk, but ſome ſmall rate for it: and in ſome Countries they preſcribe to pay no Tithe of their Milk at all; and the Cuſtom of the place in this, as in all other Tithing, is to be obſerved notwithſtanding the Canon: but for the better explanation of the meaning of this Canon there was a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Canon made, but the date thereof I cannot attain to, the tenor whereof fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>

                     <p>It is made a queſtion firſt,<note place="margin">2 Inſt. 622⸫;</note> whether any Tithes are due for Mills or not, which Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in his ſecond Inſtitutes ſays, was never judicially determined that he knows of, and it was held in the Caſe of a Fulling Mill no Tithe was due; for of profits that come only by the labour and induſtry of man no Tithe is to be paid,<note place="margin">Cro.

                     <p>The next queſtion is, admitting, that Tithes are due for mills, whether the ſame be predial or perſonal.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> is of opinion, that in Caſe any Tithe be due, it is only a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Tithe, being acquired by the labour and induſtry of the miller, and takes no Increaſe from the ground to make it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial: And the Statute of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. is, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very perſon ſhall juſtly ſet forth, yield and pay all predial Tithes in their proper kinds, as they ariſe and happen, which cannot be applyed to the Millers taking of the Toll diſh, nor to Fulling Mills, Iron Mills, Paper Mills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are all comprehended under the word mill; and no Tithe can be paid <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> for if the Parſon ſhould have every tenth Toll diſh, then it would often happen, that he ſhould have twice Tithe of the ſame Corn, which is againſt the Law, and ſuch Tithe as the Tenth Toll diſh has never
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:97586:115"/>been paid in any place, that I have known or heard of.</p>
                     <p>And if it be a perſonal Tithe, as there is great reaſon that it can be no other, then it muſt be paid with the deduction of the expences and charges, and is not payable but in ſuch places, where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Tithes are payable by Cuſtom: See more thereof in the twenty ſecond Chapter.</p>
                     <p>But the Canoniſts hold, That the tenth Toll diſh ſhall be paid as a predial Tithe without deduction of expences.</p>

                     <p>In this Act there are three qualifications. 1. It enjoyns the payment of ſuch Tithes as had for forty Years then paſt been of right yielded and paid. 2. ſuch as of right ought to have been paid. 3. ſuch as by Cuſtom ought to have been paid.</p>
                     <p>Tithes due by Cuſtom are of two kinds. 1. where there is a <hi>modus decimandi,</hi> and by Cuſtom Money or ſome other thing is paid in lieu of the Tithes. 2. where

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:97586:124"/>was afforded them in their firſt fruits.</p>
                     <p>The next charge Parſons and Vicars are ſubject to, are the Tenths,<note place="margin">Tenths.</note> that is a tenth part of the yearly value of all their Church Livings; this payment was firſt exacted from the Clergy by the Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the twentieth year of <hi>E.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">2 Inſt. 628⸫;</note> and a Valuation was then made by his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of all Church Livings, at which rate the Pope was anſwered his Tenths, but he never had any Tenths of ſuch Land as was given to the Church after that time; theſe payments (as appears by our Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> ſometimes gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Kings of <hi>England,</hi> when the Kings pleaſed him, or rather when he ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their power; but upon the aboliſhing the Popes power, which was in the 25th.<note place="margin">Stat. 25.

                     <p>But immediately upon the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion many Clergy men ſcrupled, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to pay theſe Tenths to the King,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:97586:125"/>being a duty properly due to the Pope, and therefore the refuſal or neglect to pay them to the King, being certified by the Biſhop <hi>that had the Collection of them, is made a Cauſe of Deprivation not only of the Living,<note place="margin">St. 26.

                     <p>Next, ſuppoſe a Man have barren Lands within this Law which are free from the payment of Tithes by preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, real compoſition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It ſhould ſeem by the penning of the aforeſaid <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that he ſhould pay Tithes for the ſame after the ſeven years, this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo</hi> only providing for ſuch Lands as are freed by Act of Parliament.</p>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:97586:136"/>
                     <p>But that doubt ſeems cleared by the next precedent <hi>Proviſo</hi> in this very Act, whereby it is provided.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That no Perſon ſhall be ſued or otherwiſe compelled to yield, give or pay any manner of Tithes for any Mannors, Lands, Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Hereditaments, which by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, or by any Priviledg or Preſcription are not char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable with the payment of any ſuch Tithes, or that be diſcharged by any compoſition real.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that this <hi>Proviſo</hi> preſerves all former legal diſcharges.</p>
                     <p>But the great queſtion upon this Law is, what ſhall be ſaid to be barren Heath or waſt Ground within this Law: And Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> defines barren Land in theſe words,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Terra ſterilis eſt terra infoecunda nullum ferens fructum.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Inſt. 655⸪</note> But that definition will not hold in this Caſe, for it does appear by the ſecond <hi>Proviſo</hi> that ſuch barren Lands are intended that are barren <hi>quoad Agriculturam,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Dyer 170. p. 5. Co. Ent. 462.463.</note> ſuch barren Heath or waſt Ground that of its own nature, without improvement by Lime, Marle, Manure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will not bring forth Corn or Hay.
<note place="margin">6 E. 6. per Bendloes. 2 Inſt. 656⸫;. Hill. 9. Jac. C. B. <hi>ex motione</hi> Houghton.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if Ground be not fit for Tillage, yet if it be not <hi>ſuapte natura</hi> barren, it is not within this Law. As if a Wood be ſtubbed and grub'd up, and made fit for
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:97586:137"/>the Plow, and reduced to Tillage, it ſhall pay Tithes preſently for Wood, Ground is <hi>Terra fertilis &amp; Faecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So if Mariſh,<note place="margin">2 Inſt. 656⸫; More 969.</note> Meadow or other Land by neglecting to ſcowr the Trenches or Sew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or by ſudden inundation be drowned, or if by ill husbandry or negligence fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Land be over-run with goſs, whynns, broom, fern, buſhes, briars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they ſhall not have the benefit of this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> becauſe of their own natures they are fertile and apt for Tillage, and the Parſon, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall not loſe his Tithe by the ill husbandry of the Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>If Lands were barren, Heath or waſt Ground at the time of the making of this, and were improved, and had, or might have had the benefit of this Law, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter return to their barrenneſs,<note place="margin">Co. 10.86. b⸪ Co. 6.18. a⸪</note> the Owner of ſuch Lands ſhall not have the benefit of this Law a ſecond time upon a ſecond improvement: but I take the Law to be otherwiſe, if the Lands had been impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before the time of the making of this Law, and were then become barren again, for there I take it, upon a new improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Owner of ſuch Land ſhall have the benefit of this Law.</p>
                     <p>Marſh Lands new gained from the Seas,<note place="margin">More. 430. Bulft. 165. 2 Inſt. 656⸫;</note> and fenn Lands gained from the freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by draining, banking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:97586:137"/>within the meaning of this Law to be freed from the payment of Tithes, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the firſt ſeven years after the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>But the Determination of this point, which is or which is not barren Land within this Statute? commonly falls out to be determined by common Jurors, which notwithſtanding the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Judge are ſeldom ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Church as they ought.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Proviſo</hi> only charges the payment of Corn and Hay after the ſeven years, and the ſecond <hi>Proviſo</hi> provides only for the payment of ſuch like Tithes as were formerly paid before the improvement, for the firſt ſeven years after the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

                     <p>THat which we call a real Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is,<note place="margin">Where Tithes ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by a real Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and what it is.</note> where the preſent Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent of any Church, together with his Patron and Ordinary do agree by Deed under their hands and ſeals, or by fine in the Kings Court, that ſuch Lands ſhall be freed and diſcharged of the payment of all manner of Tithes for ever, paying ſome annual payment, or doing ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to the eaſe, profit or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Parſon or Vicar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to whom the Tithes did belong:<note place="margin">Co. 4.44. a⸪ 2 Inſt. 655⸪ Doct. &amp; Stud. l. 2. cap. 55. f. ult.</note> And theſe real Compoſitions have ever been held and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed here in <hi>England</hi> to be a good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the payment of Tithes: And from theſe real Compoſitions it is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, all Preſcriptions <hi>de modo decimandi</hi> firſt took their riſe and beginning, though I doubt moſt at this day have grown up from the negligence and careleſneſs of the Clergy themſelves.</p>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:97586:138"/>
                     <p>And ſuch Compoſitions may be made by the Pariſhioner alone without the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron and Ordinary,
<note place="margin">Vide Lindw. cap. <hi>Quoniam propter verbo Redemptionem</hi> Upon this matter.</note> but it then binds on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Life of the Incumbent, and will be avoided by his Reſignation, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation, or being abſent eighty days in a year from his Cure, if he have Cure of Souls.</p>
                     <p>But it ſeems ſome of the Canoniſts and Civilians are of opinion, that all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions between the Lay and Clergy to be diſcharged wholely of payment of Tithes, or to pay leſs in recompence than the full value are invalid, but otherwiſe between Clergy-men, but by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law which muſt govern here, there is no ſuch difference allowed, but all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Compoſitions made as aforeſaid are good and valid.</p>
                     <p>But note,<note place="margin">Hob. 176⸪</note> that no Compoſition made by parol or word of mouth only, and not reduced into writing under hand and ſeal, is binding at all, unleſs it be upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord as by Fine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I conceive at this day no real Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition can be made to bind the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the Parſon or Vicar that makes the ſame, for they are now reſtrained by the <hi>Stat. of</hi> 13 <hi>El.<note place="margin">13 El. cap. 10.</note> to make any Grants o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than for twenty one years, or for three Lives with the other qualifications mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſaid Act.</hi>

                     <p>So that it ſeems clear to me, that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Vicars at this day, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the confirmation of the Patron and Ordinary, cannot charge their Benefices or any thing belonging to them, other than for twenty one years, or three Lives as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, and that only by Leaſes confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Patron and Ordinary of things uſually demiſed; whereupon the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed yearly Rent or more is reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                     <p>So that what has been ſaid concerning real Compoſitions is only to be intended of ſuch as were made before that and other later Statutes, for I take it a real Compoſition at this day will only bind the Parſon himſelf, whilſt he is Parſon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, and ſerving the Cure, <hi>quod nota.</hi>

                     <p>IT is without Diſpute,
<note place="margin">Jones 373⸪ 188⸫; Stat. 27 H. 8. cap. 28. <hi>What Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lands ſhall be freed from payment of Tithes.</hi>
                        </note> that none of the Abby Priory Lands, that came to the Crown by the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. or before, are freed or diſcharged of the payment of Tithes by the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 8. or by any other Law or Act of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>But in the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. there was a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that notwithſtanding that Act the King might by his Letters Patents under the great Seal of <hi>England</hi> continue any of the ſaid Monaſteries, and that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo</hi> is left out of all the modern Prints, only <hi>Raſtal</hi> in his abridging of that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute makes ſome mention of it.</p>
                     <p>Now the Reader muſt obſerve once for all, that all Monaſteries under two hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> were to have been diſſolved by the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and are therefore uſually called the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Abbeys, and thoſe of two hundred pounds a year and upwards were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved till the 31 year of <hi>H.</hi> 8. and are
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:97586:140"/>commonly called the great Abbeys.</p>
                     <p>And upon theſe two Statutes this Caſe lately happened in the Exchequer Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber between <hi>Walklate</hi> Farmer of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of <hi>

                        <note place="margin">31 H. 8. c. 13.</note> and ſo not diſſolved till the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. whereupon the Defendant was diſmiſſed, and diſcharged of payment of Tithes by the Stat. of 31 <hi>H.</hi> I mention this Caſe at large for the ſingularity not for any nicety in the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it.</p>

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:97586:140"/>freely, and in as large and ample manner as the ſaid Abbots,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or any of them had held, occupied, poſſeſsed, uſed, retained, or enjoyed the ſame, or any part thereof at the days of their diſſolution.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the Reader is to obſerve, that the Abbots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at the time of their diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion held their Lands diſcharged four manner of legal and regular ways, which were allowed by the Laws of this Realm, to wit.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By the Bulls of Popes. 2. By real Compoſitions with the Parſon &amp;c. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron and Ordinary. 3. By Preſcription: And 4. By Order.</p>
                     <p>But there is another ſort of diſcharge, though not a Legal one, has been allowed in this Caſe to make a 5. ſort of diſcharge, and that is perpetual unity, where the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot has had the Rectory of any Church and Lands in the ſame Pariſh time out of mind, which have been held free from the payment of Tithes by all the time of memory, and of theſe ſeveral diſcharges I will ſpeak in order.</p>
                     <p>And firſt of diſcharges by the Popes Bulls: it is to be underſtood,<note place="margin">Bulls.</note> that when the Pope uſurped a power over the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy here in <hi>England,</hi> he did at his pleaſure grant Exemptions to this or that Abbey, or to whom elſe he pleaſed to be freed from the payment of Tithes, which was allowed as a good diſcharge againſt the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:97586:141"/>Parſons and Vicars, who in many places ſuffer by theſe Bulls to this day, theſe Bulls being turned into Preſcriptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſort of diſcharges was by real Compoſitions between the Parſon or Vicar,<note place="margin">Real Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> and the Abbots, Priors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Patron and Ordinary; of theſe we have ſpoken at large before in the twentieth Chapter, and therefore ſhall not repeat it, but paſs to the third ſort of diſcharges.</p>
                     <p>The third ſort of Diſcharges is by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, of which we have likewiſe ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at large before in the ſixteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to which I ſhall refer the Reader.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall only obſerve to the Reader a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in this place, That the Abbots, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors and other religious perſons might preſcribe generally to be free from the payment, or to be diſcharged of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tithes without any recompence to the Parſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but a Layman could not preſcribe abſolutely to be free from payment of Tithes, but <hi>ſub modo</hi> that is paying or doing ſomething to, or for, the Parſon, Vicar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in recompence and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the Tithes as you may at large ſee in the Chapter here before.</p>
                     <p>And it is to be obſerved, that no Abbot, Prior, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> could make any ſuch Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Common Law, that was not founded before the time of memory, that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:97586:141"/>is before the firſt year of <hi>R.</hi> 1. which is the time of the limitation of all Preſcriptions at the Common Law,<note place="margin">2 Inſt. 653..</note> which rejects the practice of the Civil Law, which as ſhould ſeem allows the limitation of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription or cuſtom to forty years.</p>
                     <p>It may reaſonably be demanded, how this manner of diſcharge can be made out at this day, ſince there is now no Perſon living, that can prove how the Abbots held and enjoyed their Lands; to which I anſwer, that what was done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſſolution of Abbeys muſt now be proved by what has been done ſince; for if Monaſtery Lands have been held all the time of memory ſince the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, freed from the payment of Tithes, it ſhall be intended, that they were ſo held before, and therefore they have not paid or been queſtioned ſince.</p>
                     <p>The fourth ſort of diſcharge is by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">Diſcharge by Order.</note> and this diſcharge alſo for the moſt part depends upon Popes Bulls or grants, who at pleaſure granted exemption to what orders they pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>About the Year of our Lord 1150.<note place="margin">2 Inſt 652⸪ Seld. Hiſt. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cim. 120.</note> the moſt Religious orders then in being were diſcharged of the payment of Tithes; but about that time Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth reduced them to <hi>Ciſtertians, Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliers</hi> and <hi>Templers,</hi> and about the Year 1215.<note place="margin">Seld. de de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cim. 406.</note> Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third added the <hi>Praemonſtratenſes.</hi> But the Priviledges
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:97586:142"/>granted to theſe orders extended only to the Lands,<note place="margin">Dyer 277, 278.</note> theſe orders held in their own manurance, and not to any which was held by their Tenants or Farmers.</p>
                     <p>But about the beginning of the Raign of <hi>H.</hi> 4. the <hi>Ciſtertians</hi> attempted to have enlarged their priviledg to their Tenants and Farmers, which tending to the ruine of many poor Parſons and Vicars that had cure of Souls was complained of in a Parliament held in the ſecond Year of <hi>H.</hi> 4. whereupon it was enacted, that not only the <hi>Ciſtertians</hi> but all other orders that put any Bulls in execution for the diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging any of their Lands from the payment of Tithes in the Lands of their Tenants and Farmers, ſhall incur a <hi>Premunire,</hi> that is, forfeit all their Goods and the profits of their Lands during life, and be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe impriſoned during the offenders life, which gave ſuch a check to that proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I do not find any thing of that nature after attempted.</p>
                     <p>The Templers after in the Councel of <hi>Vienna,</hi>

                     <p>But there is a later Judgment that ſeems to oppoſe theſe former reſolutions, it was between one <hi>Witton</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Weſton,</hi> that was after Lord Treaſurer. <hi>Trin.</hi> 4. <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>B.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:97586:145"/>of the payment of Tithes by that Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. or by the former Statute of 31. and in that caſe <hi>Dodridg</hi> and <hi>Jones</hi> Juſtices, held that they were diſcharged within the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and they did in effect deny the Books before cited to be Law, the chief Juſtice <hi>Hide</hi> was of opinion that they were not diſcharged by the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. but by that of 32. So that by their three opinions the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Sir <hi>Richard Weſton</hi> had judgment; but <hi>Whitlock</hi> was of opinion that thoſe Lands were not diſcharged of the payment of Tithes by the one Statute or the other: now upon the whole matter I ſhall ſubmit to the Judicious Readers Judgment whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this later reſolution be of any weight to ſhake the former reſolutions, ſince in this caſe though there were three for giving Judgment for the Defendant, yet to the point controverted upon the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. they were two againſt two, and that they were not diſcharged by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 32. there were three againſt the chief Juſtice <hi>Hide.</hi> So that I conceive the Law remains according to the former reſolutions, that there are no Lands freed from the payment of Tithes by any Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, but thoſe that came to the Crown by the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
                     <p>I muſt confeſs I have met with no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon thoſe Lands which came to the Crown by the Statute of 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. but

I conceive neither thoſe that came to the Crown by either of thoſe later Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes have any priviledg at all, and it is agreed in that very caſe of <hi>Witton</hi> and <hi>Weſton</hi> that thoſe Lands that came to the Crown by 1 <hi>E.</hi>

                     <p>So that I ſhall conclude that there is no Land can have any priviledg at this day to be diſcharged of Tithes that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Abbots, Priors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſuch only as came to the Crown by the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 13.</p>

                     <p>This Act of Parliament reſtrains the Canon Law in two things; firſt, where the Canon was general, that all perſons in all places ſhould pay their perſonal Tithes, the Act reſtrains it to ſuch kind of perſons only, as have accuſtomably u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to pay the ſame, within forty years before the making of the Act. Secondly, Whereas by the Eccleſiaſtical Laws they might before this Act have examined the Party upon his Oath concerning his gain; this Act reſtrains that courſe, ſo that the Party cannot be examined upon Oath; and by this Act the day labourer is freed of the payment of his perſonal Tithes.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be intended upon this Act, that if ſuch Tithes have been ſometimes paid within forty years, that they are therefore due, but they muſt have been accuſtomably, that is conſtantly, paid for forty years next before the Act.</p>
                     <p>And if it be demanded how ſuch pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt now be proved forty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the making of the ſaid Act, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, as in other like Caſes <hi>à poſteriore</hi> by what has been done all the time of memory ſince the Act.</p>
                     <p>There has been ſome queſtion amongſt the School-men and Canoniſts, whether perſonal Tithes ought to be paid of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful gain, to which you ſhall hear what a great Schoolman and Doctor ſays.</p>

                     <p>So that by this great Doctors opinion, it ſeems, that of ill gotten gain, of which reſtitution ought to be made, no perſonal Tithe is due, and yet if by ill gotten gain, a field be purchaſed, Tithe ought to be paid of the fruits thereof, but of ill gotten gain, where no Reſtitution is to be made, there Tithes ought to be paid, but not received by the Church, till the ſinner have repented him of the evil, and after ſuch repentance the Church may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them.</p>

                     <p>So that upon the whole matter it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, there were ſome offerings free and voluntary, which the Pariſhioners or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were not bound to perform, but <hi>ad libitum.</hi> There were others by Cuſtom certain and obligatory, as thoſe for Marriages, Chriſtnings, Churching of Women, Burials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that theſe were

                     <p>And by the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">Stat. 32.

                     <p>And now having ſhewed in how many Courts,<note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> and how many ways Tithes may be recovered, it calls to my mind the Fable of the Fox and the Cat who had but one way to ſhift for her ſelf when the Hunts men came, but that one proved better and more ſecure than all the ſhifts the Fox had boaſted of; for upon the whole matter it were much better for the Reverend Clergy if they had one ready way to recover ſingle damages with their coſts of Suits at Common Law where they might not be interrupted by Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions, and claſhing of Juriſdictions, and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:97586:177"/>toſt from one Court to another, than all theſe ways I have mentioned. And it is a wonder to me that there being hardly a Lord in Parliament, nor many of the Houſe of Commons that have not ſome part of their Eſtates in impropriations, though they had no kindneſs to the Church, yet for their own intereſt and concerns have not to that purpoſe prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome Law in Parliament before this time which might be done in a few lines by giving an Action of the Caſe at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law for the ſubtraction of Tithes with coſts, or if the Parliament ſhould think fit the ſmaller ſort of Tithes might be determined in a Summary way by the Juſtices of Peace with an appeal to the Judges of Aſſiſe, but this I humbly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit as I do all the reſt to better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>I have now finiſhed this ſmall Tract whereby I wiſh the Reverend Clergy may receive as much ſatisfaction as I deſire,<note place="margin">The concluſion of the whole.</note> or they can expect. And I ſhall now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all with a Liſt of thoſe Monaſteries, the Lands of which are only capable to be diſcharged of the payment of Tithes, by Order, Bull, Preſcription, real com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or otherwiſe, that every Clergy man may ſatisfy himſelf without further enquiry whether ſuch Monaſtery Lands as ſhall happen to be in his Pariſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may have the benefit of the Statute of 31

                     <p>And it is without diſpute that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Monaſteries, eſpecially thoſe of priviledged Orders, tended very much to the prejudice of the Secular Clergy that had the Cure of Souls; for beſide the orders that were priviledged they appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated all the Churches, they could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and how ill they were ſerved a Man may in ſome meaſure obſerve that peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Statute of 15 <hi>R.</hi> 2. and 4 <hi>H.</hi> 4. for it appears by them that they endowed no Vicarage at all upon the appropriating Churches, or ſo meanly,<note place="margin">Endowment of Vicarages.</note> that the Vicars could not live upon them, and not at all Hoſpitality practiſed.
